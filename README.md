Clustering with Kmeans

### 1. Import data file (.csv) into 1 R object
### 2. Clustering with 2 attributes and 3 clusters
### 3. Compare the results
### 4. Visualize the results

##### Analysis #####
Part 1 - Plot is very easy to see the 3 clusters.  There is 1 point (sweeden) that could almost go into
any of the 3 groups.  The cluster furthest to the right (5 points) is unique to the other 2 with respect
to the RedMeat, where the other 2 clusters more to the left are similar in RedMeat, but unique in WhiteMeat
The 'withinss' is relatively small as all data points are close the centroid.

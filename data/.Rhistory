# Assignment #2 - part 1
#
# 1. Import data file (.csv) into 1 R object
# 2. Clustering with 2 attributes and 3 clusters
# 3. Compare the results
# 4. Visualize the results
# Load dplyr - used for 'select' function
library(dplyr)

# Read in rows from the file in the working directory
protein <- read.csv(file="protein.csv",head=TRUE,sep=",")
## PART 1 ##
# Create copy of protein object (protein1)
protein1 <- protein
# Remove columns not included in p (part 1 just uses 'RedMeat' and 'WhiteMeat' attributes)
protein1 <- select(protein1, RedMeat, WhiteMeat)
View(protein1)
# Clustering with 3 clusters:
kmeans.result1 <- kmeans(protein1, 3)
View(kmeans.result1)
# The clustering result is then compared with the class label.  Each row (n) is set to a particular cluster.  No country falls into 2 ore more clusters
table(protein$Country, kmeans.result1$cluster)
# Plot the clusters: (below attributes are what is clustered in the plot)

# Plot cluster centers:
